abcd etlinffmd The eXpOS package that you had downloaded in the previous stage consists mainly of a machine simulator. The machine is called the eXperimental String Machine (XSM) and consists of a processor, memory and disk. Some support tools that help you to program the machine are also provided.

One important point to note about the system is that the machine is a bare, and comes with no software in it (except for a boot ROM). Hence, the only way to insert some software code into the system is to prepare the code "outside" (that is, in your Linux/Unix system) and insert your code into the machine. The support tools provided along with the package are precisely designed to help you with this task.

The package comes with three major support tools - two compilers and a disk interface tool called XFS-Interface. The compilers allow you to write high level code and translate it into the XSM machine code. We will look at them in later stages. The XFS-Inteface tool helps you to transfer files between your Linux/Unix system and the XSM machines disk.
